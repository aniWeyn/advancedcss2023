    <h3>Design System</h3>
    <p>
      A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices
      coherently organized. Design Systems aid in digital product design and
      development of products such as apps or websites. They may contain, but
      are not limited to, pattern libraries, design languages, style guides,
      coded components, brand languages, and documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It serves as a reference or source of truth that helps the different teams
      involved (such as designers, developers, copywriters and project managers)
      to design and build digital products.
    </p>

    <p>Some of the advantages of a design system are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>faster builds, through reusable components and shared rationale.</li>
      <li>
        better products, through more cohesive user experiences and a consistent
        design language.
      </li>
      <li>
        improved maintenance and scalability, through the reduction of design
        and technical debt.
      </li>
      <li>
        stronger focus for product teams, through tackling common problems so
        teams can concentrate on solving user needs.
      </li>
    </ul>
