    <h3>Pseudo classes</h3>
    <p>
      The : pseudo allow the selection of elements based on state information
      that is not contained in the document tree. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to
      the content of the document tree,<br />
      but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator
      (:visited, for example), <br />
      the status of its content (like :checked on certain form elements), <br />
      or the position of the mouse (like :hover, which lets you know if the
      mouse is over an element or not).
