          Your project needs to describe important enviromental/health/social issue (see example from Thanks in Advance). 
          That issue needs to be described in interesting way which tells a story. 
          When you will be decided about the story it is time to put it into design. 
          Your design needs to reflect animations and drawings which you will develop in final project.
          You can prepare designs as drawing or in digital for such as Figma. The most important is that your group will well define your project.
        </p>
        <p class="space font--small">
          Create repostory for Final Project. Start your work on Read.me file, add all group members as contributors, 
          every group member needs to submit one pull request which has to be reviewd and accepted by two other group members, create a project board with columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).
          Define your design in small tasks which describe development activity, plan how you will redistirbute work among group members. 
          Fill To Do column with development tasks and assign group members.
