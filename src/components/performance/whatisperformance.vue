    <p>Web performance is the objective measurements and the perceived user experience of load time and runtime. 
        <br><br>Web performance is 
        <ul>
            <li>
        how long a site takes to load, 
            </li>
            <li>
        become interactive and responsive, 
            </li>
            <li>
            and how smooth the content is during user interactions
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Web performance includes both objective measurements like 
            <ul>
                <li>
            time to load, 
                </li>
                <li>
                frames per second, 
                </li>
                <li>
                and time to become interactive,
                </li>
                </ul> 
                and subjective experiences of how long it felt like it took the content to load.</p>
