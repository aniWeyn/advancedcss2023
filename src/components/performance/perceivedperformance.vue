    <h3>Perceived Performance</h3>
    <p>Perceived performance is a subjective measure of website performance, responsiveness, and reliability. 
        <br />In other words, how fast a website seems to the user.</p>
<p>when loading a page it is better to display the text when it arrives rather than wait for all the images and other resources. Even though the content has not fully downloaded the user can see something is happening and they can start interacting with the content.</p>

<p>It is better to display a "loading animation" as soon as a user clicks a link to perform a long running operation. While this doesn't change the time taken to complete the operation, the site feels more responsive, and the user knows that it is working on something useful.</p>
