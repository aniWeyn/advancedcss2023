    <p class="italic">
      "Graceful degradation is a design philosophy <br />
      that centers around trying to build a modern web site/application <br />
      that will work in the newest browsers,<br />
      but falls back to an experience that<br />
      while not as good still delivers essential content <br />
      and functionality in older browsers."

    <h4>What does it means in practice?</h4>

      will not be loaded for some reason, the page will be still usable.
    </p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
