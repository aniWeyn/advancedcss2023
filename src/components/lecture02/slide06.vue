    <p class="italic">
      "Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy <br />
      that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality <br />
      to as many users as possible, <br />
      while delivering the best possible experience<br />
      only to users of the most modern browsers <br />
      that can run all the required code."

    <h4>What does it means in practice?</h4>

      The CSS and JS will only enhance the page.
