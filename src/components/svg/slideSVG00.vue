    <h3>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</h3>
    <p>
      Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are an
      <strong>XML-based markup language</strong> for describing
      <strong>two-dimensional based vector graphics</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, it's a text-based, open Web standard for describing images that
      can be
      <strong
        >rendered cleanly at any size and are designed specifically to work well
        with other web standards including CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and
        SMIL</strong
      >. SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text.
    </p>
    <p>
      SVG images and their related behaviors are defined in XML text files,
      which means they can be
      <strong>searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed</strong>.
      Additionally, this means they can be created and edited with any text
      editor or with drawing software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to classic bitmapped image formats such as JPEG or PNG,
      SVG-format vector images can be
      <strong>rendered at any size without loss of quality</strong> and can be
      easily localized by updating the text within them, without the need of a
      graphical editor to do so. With proper libraries, SVG files can even be
      localized on-the-fly.
