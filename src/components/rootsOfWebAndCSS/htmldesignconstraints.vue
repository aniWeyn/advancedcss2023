    <h3>HTML Design Constraints</h3>
    <p>“When designing the HTML document type, consideration was given to a <strong>certain simplicity</strong> in order <strong>to allow many browsers and hopefully editors to be developed on many platforms.</strong>”</p>
    <p><strong>“It is required that HTML be a common language between all platforms.</strong> This implies <strong>no device-specific markup</strong>, or anything which requires control over fonts or colors, for example. This is in keeping with the SGML ideal.”</p>
