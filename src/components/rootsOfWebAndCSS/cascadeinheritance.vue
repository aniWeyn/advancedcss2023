    <h3>Cascade and inheritance</h3>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</p>
    <p>The <strong>cascade</strong>, and the closely-related concept of <strong>specificity</strong>, are mechanisms that control which rule applies when there is such a conflict.</p>
    <p>Also significant here is the concept of <strong>inheritance</strong>, which means that some CSS properties by default inherit values set on the current element's parent element, and some don't. </p>
