    <h3>Specificity</h3>
    <p>Specificity is how the browser decides which rule applies if multiple rules have different selectors, but could still apply to the same element. It is basically a measure of how specific a selector's selection will be:

An element selector is less specific — it will select all elements of that type that appear on a page — so will get a lower score.
A class selector is more specific — it will select only the elements on a page that have a specific class attribute value — so will get a higher score.</p>
