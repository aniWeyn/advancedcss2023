      </h3>
      <p>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them equal opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances. 
          </p>
          <p>Providing accessible sites is part of the law in some countries</p>

      <p class="action--highlight">
        <strong>By default, HTML is accessible, if used correctly.</strong> Web
        accessibility involves ensuring that content remains accessible,
        regardless of who and how the web is accessed.
