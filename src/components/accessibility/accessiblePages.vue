          Sites should be accessible to keyboard, mouse, and touch screen users,
          and any other way users access the web, including screen readers and
          voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home.
        </li>
        <li>
          Applications should be understandable and usable by people regardless
          of auditory, visual, physical, or cognitive abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sites should also not cause harm: web features like motion can cause
          migraines or epileptic seizures.

      </ol>

        <strong>By default, HTML is accessible, if used correctly.</strong> Web
        accessibility involves ensuring that content remains accessible,
        regardless of who and how the web is accessed.
